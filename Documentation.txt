This log describes the content envisioned for the Peer Pledge
web page / application.

User will see a main page featuring inspirational images, appeals to give,
and emotives/icons indicating recent pledges and pledge peggings.  Easily visible
will be a charity lookup which doubles as a friend finder so that user can "peg" to
a friends pledge.  I envision a mashup of elements from several peer to peer
fundraising and money sharing apps.

The app will pull named, legally formed charity content from an API to determine the
payee.  Using social networking app integration features, user will be able to connect
to peers to encourage giving or to see what peer activity exists.

A shopping cart / checkout and pay feature will be used to capture the pledge/donation.

A database will be used to commit transaction history and present to user upon demand.
