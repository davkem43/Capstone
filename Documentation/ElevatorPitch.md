# Peer Pledge, a Capstone project

## The target audience will be mentors, peers, instructors, recruiters, investors, and ultimately, people interested in growing global generosity (G-3).

### Peer Pledge is a single page web application that creates a "space" for people to find a charity that they would like to contribute to, invite friends to join them, and foster a community of everyday sharing and giving.  Integration with social media tools allows everyone to share their generosity and grow giving by sharing.  Imagine going to a space where you can see the generosity your peers have shown and join them in everyday giving.

**With a successful launch and community adoption this application could transform "Giving Tuesday" from an annual event to a worldwide mindset!**
