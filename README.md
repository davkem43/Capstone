# This file documents my Capstone project

## This project is a single page web application that creates a "space" for users to contribute to a charity, invite friends to join them, and foster a community of everyday sharing and giving.  Future integration with social media tools envisioned.  With a successful launch and community adoption this application could transform "Giving Tuesday" from an annual event to a worldwide mindset!

### The target audience will be mentors, peers, instructors, recruiters, investors, and ultimately, people interested in growing global generosity (G-3).

#### In this repository you can find everything from the conceptual drawings to the finished product.

##### It's a work in process.
